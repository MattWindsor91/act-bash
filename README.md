# act-bash

This repository contains various utility scripts for automating common tasks
in [act](https://github.com/MattWindsor91/act) and
[act-tester](https://github.com/MattWindsor91/act-tester).

## Health Warning

These scripts generally aren't maintained with the same amount of frequency or
urgency as the `act` and `act-tester` projects, and may code rot as the project
develops.  Use with caution.

##Â Usage

- Each script requires `bash`, as well as the `act` (and/or `act-tester`)
  binaries in `PATH`.
- Most of the scripts have inline documentation near the top of the script.

## Licence

MIT; see `LICENSE`.
