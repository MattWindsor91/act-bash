# c4-scripts

This repository contains various utility scripts for automating common tasks
in [c4t](https://github.com/MattWindsor91/c4t) and
[c4f](https://github.com/MattWindsor91/c4f).

## Health Warning

These scripts generally aren't maintained with the same amount of frequency or
urgency as the _c4t_ and _c4f_ projects, and may code-rot as the project
develops.  Use with caution.

##Â Usage

- Each script requires `bash`, as well as the `c4t-*` and/or `c4f-*`
  binaries in `PATH`.
- Most of the scripts have inline documentation near the top of the script.

## Licence

MIT; see `LICENSE`.
